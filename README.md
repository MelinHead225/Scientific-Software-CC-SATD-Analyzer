# Scientific-Software-CC-SATD-Analyzer

This repository is an artifact from the research paper: 

Exploring Scientific Debt: Harnessing AI for SATD Identification in
Scientific Software.

The notebook ```SSW_SATD_Analyzer.ipynb``` is a script that leverages a fine-tuned version of BERT-large for identifying SATD source code comments in scientific software. To use simply replace the line ```"https://github.com/healpy/healpy.git"``` in the notebook with your selected github repository that you would like to analyze. The script will then output relevant information pertaining to SATD in the respository along with saving a CSV file with all identified SATD instances and file paths.

For any questions or inquires please reach out to ericmelin@u.boisestate.edu.
